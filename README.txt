Dynamic TSEA works in two stages:

Stage 1 is dynamic HLSEA wherein the individual objectives are optimized to obtain initial tours named DYNAMIC_TOUR1 for the first objective and DYNAMIC_TOUR2 for second objective.
stage 2 is dynamic SHLSEA wherein the corner solutions (DYNAMIC_TOUR1 and DYNAMIC_TOUR2) obtained from dynamic HLSEA are seeded to multiobjective problem, to obtain the Pareto Plot. 

Note that.tsp files are the inputs.
